    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
        I'm an XR Developer studying GIMM (Gaming Interactive Media and Mobile Technology) at Boise State University. I love all aspects of game design, from coding and conceptualizing to rigging and animating. I enjoy bringing my artistic creativity to life through technology in new and fascinating ways and I hope to help build the future of mixed reality and spatial computing.
