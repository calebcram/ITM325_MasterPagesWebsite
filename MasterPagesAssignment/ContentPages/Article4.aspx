        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority 
        have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which
        don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem 
        Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle 
        of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined
        chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses 
        a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence 
        structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem 
        Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or 
        non-characteristic words etc.
